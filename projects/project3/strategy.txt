I ignored the fact that we were given read-pairs and considered everything as a single read. I then broke the
reads down into 25-mers, and removed any 25-mers with a frequency <= 3 because those have a high probability
of being erroneous. I then constructed a de Bruijn graph with the 25-mers as the edges (with duplicate edges
removed). Then, I found all of the maximal non-branching paths in the de Bruijn graph, and I formed the contigs
from those paths.
